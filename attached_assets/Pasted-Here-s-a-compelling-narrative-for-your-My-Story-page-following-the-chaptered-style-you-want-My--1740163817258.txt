My Story

1. School Days – A Rebel Without a Cause

I was a terrible student. Not because I wasn’t capable, but because I didn’t see the point. The rigid structure of school felt like a waste of time—except for two things: Music and Rugby. These were my real passions.

Then, one teacher changed everything. They introduced me to logic, debate, ethics, and philosophy—a world where ideas had weight, arguments had structure, and everything could be questioned. I was hooked. This led me to apply to study philosophy at university, where I finally found something worth obsessing over.

2. Philosophy, Poker, and Heavy Metal

University transformed me. I went from a disengaged student to an academic powerhouse—driven not by grades, but by sheer curiosity. I fell in love with philosophy, devoured texts on ethics, consciousness, and logic, and thrived in intellectual debate.

But philosophy wasn’t my only obsession. I also:
🎸 Started a heavy metal band—Crocadillapig (yes, that was the name), playing shows across the UK and Europe.
♠️ Became a serious poker player, fascinated by the mix of psychology, probability, and strategy.
🛠 Started my first business—a guitar & amp repair shop, blending my love for music with hands-on craftsmanship.

For a while, I thought I’d follow the academic path. But then, life threw a curveball.

3. PhD Fallthrough & A New Path

I was on track to start a PhD in Philosophy, but my funding fell through. Suddenly, I had to rethink everything.

Instead of staying in academia, I joined OpenRoom Events, where I put on B2B forums—including the first veterinary event for the APAC region. It was an entirely new world for me, but I thrived in the challenge.

Then, the pandemic hit. The UK government essentially shut down business indefinitely. Everything paused.

I saw how heavy-handed the UK’s response was and decided I needed a change. I packed my bags and moved to the least COVID-affected place I could find—Austin, Texas.

4. The Tech Awakening

In Austin, I landed a role in partnerships at AppSumo, working directly with Noah Kagan. That’s where I saw firsthand the scalable power of technology.

Startups weren’t just businesses—they were force multipliers, enabling a small team to have an outsized impact. After 9 months at AppSumo, my business partner and I launched ShopSwap, a collaborative growth network for eCommerce brands.

This was my first taste of building in tech, but something bigger was about to shift.

5. Obsession with AI

A few months into my startup journey, GPT-3 was released, and it changed everything. I immediately saw its potential and became obsessed.

At first, I focused on consumer AI tools, but I quickly realized something:
The chatbot paradigm wasn’t working for businesses. AI adoption was too fragmented, too ineffective. For AI to truly scale, fundamental changes were needed.

That realization set the stage for my next big move.

6. Indigo AI – Building the Future

That’s why Corey and I founded Indigo AI—to solve the AI adoption problem for small businesses.

We’re 6 months in, and I couldn’t be more excited about what we’re building. The vision is massive, the market is ready, and we’re moving fast.

Everything I’ve done—philosophy, music, poker, startups, tech, and AI—has led me here.

And we’re just getting started.
