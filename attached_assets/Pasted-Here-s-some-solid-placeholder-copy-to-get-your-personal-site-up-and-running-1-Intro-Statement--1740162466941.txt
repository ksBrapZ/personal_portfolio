1. Intro Statement – ‘Hi, I’m Keyana 👋…’

Hi, I’m Keyana 👋 I build things, break things, and obsess over making them better. As the Co-Founder & CEO of Indigo AI, I’m working to bring AI’s full potential to small businesses. When I’m not deep in startup mode, you’ll find me wrenching on my 4Runner and DR650, climbing in the mountains, or getting lost in a good book. I believe in building a life with intention—one that prioritizes family, adventure, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

2. About Section

I’ve always been drawn to systems—whether that’s scaling AI for small businesses, optimizing a motorcycle’s performance, or mapping out the best way to summit a peak. As the CEO & Co-Founder of Indigo AI, I spend my days solving complex problems in the AI space. Outside of work, I’m deeply into mechanical projects, from maintaining my Toyota 4Runner and Suzuki DR650 to tweaking gear for maximum efficiency.

When I’m not covered in grease or buried in strategy decks, I’m either climbing, hiking, or running—pushing my limits outdoors is a big part of who I am. I’ve recently picked up photography again, capturing landscapes and moments that tell a story. And when it’s time to unwind, you’ll find me reading classics, exploring AI’s future, or researching my next favorite piece of gear.

Big-picture, I’m building a life centered around family, adventure, and long-term thinking. That means working toward financial freedom, designing a home with space to breathe, and being the kind of partner and (future) parent who’s present and engaged.

3. ‘Favorites’ Page Summary

This is my favorites page, where I keep a running list of the best things I’ve found—whether it’s game-changing software, rock-solid tools, or everyday essentials I swear by. If it’s here, I’ve tested it, used it, and would recommend it without hesitation.

Think of this as a curated list of things that just work.
